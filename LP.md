# Luke Polson

I am a PhD student in medical physics at the **University of British Columbia**. In my spare time I like ripping around on my bicycle, going to the gym/weightlifting, and stealing hearts with my guitar. I also have a youtube channel, [Mr. P Solver](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKaYxkHrmsQePZFpzF9b7sQ), where I make physics/python tutorials.
