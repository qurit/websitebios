My name is Shahriar, a Physics graduate student at UBC (Vancouver). In my free time I like to get take walks around Vancouver. 

Papers that I worked on:

1. [Radio impulsive events in quiet solar corona and Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00004)


2. [X-ray annual modulation observed by XMM-Newton and Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00632)


3. [Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: Time Modulations and Amplifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04675)


4. [Gravitationally trapped axions on Earth](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00022)
